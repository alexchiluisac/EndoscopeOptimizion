# Notched Endoscope Designer
The Notched Endoscope Research Design Software (NERDS) is a MATLAB application
developed by the [COgnitive MEdical Technology (COMET)](https://www.wpicometlab.com/) Robotics Laboratory
at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) (WPI). This application allows for the design of
 a surgical continuum robotic endoscope for various medical or industrial applications.
The most feasible application of a notched tube endscope is for insertion through
the nose and into the Eustachian Tube to survey the middle ear. Through actuation of
the distal end, this endoscope can view a significant portion of the middle ear.

This software allows for the design, optimization and personalization of the
notched tube endoscope for any application. The user can upload a medical model
of a patient and create a personalized endoscope. The simulation is controlled
using the keyboard, or a Wii Nunchuk.

Visit the GitBook Wiki linked below for additional help with setting up this
application.
